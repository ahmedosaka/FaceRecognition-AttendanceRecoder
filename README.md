## This is a face detection and attendence recording project.
## First You will need to install opencv, numpy, dlib and face_recognition using pip
## To use it all you need to do is to put images from your choice of the persons you want to detect in "ImagesAttendance" folder. 
## Then if you run "faceRecognition-attendaceProject.py" it will detect the face showing in the webcamera. 
## If you don't have a web camera, you can replace it with a photo of your choice.
## Here is a sample of the result

## If you tried to show people who are not registered in the database, it will show out that the face is for "Unknow Person"

## After detecting the face and knows who is that person, It will record the name and time in the CSV file so that you can manage to know who entered your place.
